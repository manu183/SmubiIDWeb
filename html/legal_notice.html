            <strong>Liability for content</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> The contents of our pages have been prepared with the greatest care. However, we cannot assume any liability
            for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for
            our own content on these pages in accordance with ยง 7 Section 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According
            to ยง 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obliged as service providers to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
            information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
            use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect
            is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete violation of the law. As soon as we become aware of
            such violations of the law, we will remove these contents immediately.

            <strong>Liability for links</strong>
            <br>
            <br> Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence. Therefore,
            we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages
            is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
            infringements at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However,
            permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation
            of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

                <br>
                <br> The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                Duplication, editing, distribution and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the written
                consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private,
                non-commercial use. As far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights
                of third parties are respected. In particular, the contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you
                nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. As soon as we become
                aware of any such infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

                <strong>Data Protection</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as on our sides personal
                data (for example name, address or email addresses) are raised, this takes place, as far as possible, always
                on voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
                <br> We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
                security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
                <br> The use of the contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending
                unsolicited advertising and information material is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of these pages
                expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information being
                sent, for example in the form of spam mails.
